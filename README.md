Easily add a configurable cookie consent banner to your Umbraco site. Features include a dashboard for customizing behavior, appearance, and translations, using the Orestbida/CookieConsent library.

## Configuration

1. **Access the dashboard**  
Navigate to the Settings tab in the Umbraco Backoffice, and then select the Cookie Consent dashboard to manage all settings related to your banner.

2. **Customize appearance and behavior**  
   Use the dashboard to configure:  
   - **Position** of the banner on your site.  
   - **Categories** of cookies to display.  
   - **Layout** and styles to match your siteâ€™s design.
   - ...
 
3. **Manage translations**  
   - Translations for the popup text can be managed in the **Translations** section of Umbraco, under the key `Our.Umbraco.CookieConsent`.  
   - The available languages for the cookie consent popup depend on the languages configured for your Umbraco site.

4. **Render the banner in your layout**
   To display the cookie banner on your website, add the following line in your main layout file (`_Layout.cshtml` or equivalent):
   ```csharp
   @await Component.InvokeAsync("Cookie")
   ```
