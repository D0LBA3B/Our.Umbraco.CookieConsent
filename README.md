Easily add a configurable cookie consent banner to your Umbraco site. Features include a dashboard for customizing behavior, appearance, and translations, using the Orestbida/CookieConsent library.

## Configuration

1. **Access the dashboard**  
Navigate to the Settings tab in the Umbraco Backoffice, and then select the Cookie Consent dashboard to manage all settings related to your banner.

2. **Customize appearance and behavior**  
   Use the dashboard to configure:  
   - **Position** of the banner on your site.  
   - **Categories** of cookies to display.  
   - **Layout** and styles to match your siteâ€™s design.
   - ...
 
3. **Manage translations**  
   - Translations for the popup text can be managed in the **Translations** section of Umbraco, under the key `Our.Umbraco.CookieConsent`.  
   - The available languages for the cookie consent popup depend on the languages configured for your Umbraco site.

4. **Render the banner in your layout**
   To display the cookie banner on your website, add the following line in your main layout file (`_Layout.cshtml` or equivalent):
   ```csharp
   @await Component.InvokeAsync("Cookie")
   ```

## Scripts by category

You can define custom scripts that are injected only **after user consent**, based on the selected cookie category (e.g. Analytics, Marketing, etc.).

To do so:
- Navigate to the **"Scripts"** section in the dashboard
- Add a new entry with the target category (`Analytics`, `Marketing`, etc.)
- Paste your script using **safe** JS, such as dynamic script injection

**Important**: HTML `<script>` tags **cannot** be directly used inside JavaScript blocks. Instead, use JavaScript to create and inject scripts dynamically.

### Example: Google Analytics script

```js
    var gtagScript = document.createElement('script');
    gtagScript.src = 'https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-CN4GDXXXXX';
    gtagScript.async = true;
    document.head.appendChild(gtagScript);

    gtagScript.onload = function () {
        window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
        function gtag(){ dataLayer.push(arguments); }
        window.gtag = gtag;

        gtag('js', new Date());
        gtag('config', 'G-XXXX');
    };
```

This logic will only be executed if the user accepts the **analytics** category
